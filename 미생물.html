<p style="margin-bottom:10px;"> A <strong><a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/미생물" title="한국어 ver">
  microorganism</a></strong>, or microbe,[a]
  is an organism of microscopic size, which may exist in its
   single-celled form or as a colony of cells.The possible
   existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from
   ancient times, such as in Jain scriptures from sixth
   century BC India. The scientific study of microorganisms
   began with their observation under the microscope in the
   1670s by Anton van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur
   found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking
   the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s, Robert
    Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases
    tuberculosis, cholera, diphtheria, and anthrax.

<p> Because microorganisms include most unicellular organisms
  from all three domains of life they can be extremely diverse.
   Two of the three domains Archaea and Bacteria, only contain
   icroorganisms. The third domain Eukaryota includes all
   multicellular organisms as well as many unicellular
   protists and protozoans that are microbes. Some protists
   are related to animals and some to green plants.
   There are also many multicellular organisms that
   are microscopic, namely micro-animals, some fungi,
   and some algae, but these are generally not considered
   microorganisms.</p>
